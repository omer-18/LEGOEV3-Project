V 2.0 IS FINAL FILE WITH COMPLETE WORKING CODE

Welcome to our project page! Here you can find our full code for the autonomous delivery robot.

As part of our Mechatronics final design project, Anjanan Thirumahan, Omer Sajid, Jayden Mangaroo and I tasked ourselves with creating a robot that was able to deliver a given object to a desired end point, while traversing difficult terrain. 

This was achieved by programming the Robot in ROBOTC and implementing ultrasonic, infrared, and colour sensors to carry out the obstacle detection and avoidance/traversal functions. The physical system was equally as intricate, as we had to come up with a design that could avoid obstacles but also climb over them when necessary. After much ideation, we settled on a 4 wheel design featuring two lever arms positioned at the front and the back end of the robot.

To say we didn't encounter any challenges along the way would be an understatement, as there were several problems throughout the course of this project that required us to re approach our design. Regardless, we are extremely grateful for this opportunity and for the experienced gained.
